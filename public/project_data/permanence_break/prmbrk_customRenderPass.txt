By far my largest contribution to the project was implementing the object permanence mechanic. In order to detect which object were on screen at any time, I created a custom render pass in Unity's Scriptable Render Pipeline.
This render pass draws all objects with special permanence rules as a single unique value in the R channel of a texture. This texture is then checked on the GPU using a compute shader that returns a list of all visible objects
based on which colors it found in the texture.
