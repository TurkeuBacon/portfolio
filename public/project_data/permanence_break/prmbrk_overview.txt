Permanence Break is a first-person puzzle platformer which revolves around objects who's behavior changes depending on if they are being observed.
It was developed using the Unity Game Engine over the course of six months for the Computer Game Design capstone series at UCSC, by myself and four other student developers.
Amongst team managment, my main contributions to the project include core gameplay programming, concepting, and level design.
