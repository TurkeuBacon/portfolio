Permanence Break is a first-person puzzle platformer which revolves around objects who's behavior changes depending on if they are being observed.
It was developed using Unity over the course of six months for the Computer Game Design capstone series at UCSC.
My team consisted of myself and four other student developers.
On top of team managment, my main contributions to the project include core gameplay programming, concepting, and level design.
